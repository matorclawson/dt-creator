# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Point repository, documentation, badge and package-metadata links at `zeroemployeeorg/zeocreator` and `zeroemployeeorg.github.io/zeocreator` after the repository move; the old GitHub Pages address no longer resolves. Version tags and commit pins are unchanged.
- State the required PyPI trusted publisher and that its current configuration is unverified since the move.
- **CLI output follows Zeocore's `cli_protocol` 1.** Every command except `runtime-provider` prints exactly one JSON line on stdout, the result, which carries `ok`. Lists are wrapped: `capabilities` answers `{"ok": true, "capabilities": [...]}` (or `"tools"` with `--projection openai`), `contracts list` answers `"contracts"`, `contract-schema` answers `"schema"`, and `--version` answers `{"ok": true, "zeocreator": ..., "cli_protocol": "1"}`. The tables are gone; `--json` is still accepted and changes nothing. A usage error prints its usage on stderr and `{"ok": false, "outcome": "invalid_request"}` on stdout; running with no command is a usage error.
- **Exit codes follow `cli_protocol` 1** (catch-up: merged in #20 without an entry): a failed `doctor` check exits 20, not 1; 1 is an internal error, with `{"ok": false, "outcome": "internal"}` and no detail; 2 is invalid input.
- `runtime-provider` keeps its canonical bytes, without `ok`, until Runtime confirms a reader for the JSON-lines form; then it changes in one release.
- Add `make install VERSION=X.Y.Z`, which installs a published release as a tool and runs `doctor` (catch-up: merged in #20 without an entry).
- Publishing runs in the GitHub environments `pypi` and `testpypi`, so an upload waits for approval once the environment requires a reviewer.
- Drop the direct `rich` dependency, which the CLI no longer uses; Typer still installs it.
- **Agentic experience (standard v1):** `zeo-creator help --json` is a machine catalogue of every command, option, exit code and output schema id. Every result carries `"schema": "zeocreator.<thing>/v1"`. `contract-schema` now answers the schema under `json_schema` (unreleased rename; `schema` is the id). Shell-completion options are gone.
- **Next steps (standard v1, rules 6 and 7):** `doctor` lists each failing check with the command that fixes it, under `next`. An invalid request carries a fixed `reason` and a `next` command, never the input. The unknown-contract `message` (unreleased) becomes `reason`.
- Email links refuse a backslash, which browsers read as a path separator but URL parsers don't, so a link can't show one host and open another. This applies to `EmailLink` and the body renderer alike.
- Add `zeo_creator.rendering.render_email_body`, a pure renderer from structured blocks to an accessible, escaped HTML fragment for a template slot, with its plain-text twin and digests that match `EmailDeliveryMaterial`.
- **Require `zeocore[runtime-host]==0.15.0`** (was 0.11.0). Zeocore 0.15.0 makes every runtime-host name Creator uses public, and its runtime-host-v1 protocol files are byte-identical to 0.11.0's. `doctor` reports the check as `zeocore_0_15_0`.

The entries below record the earlier Git-only development history.

## 0.5.3.dev0 — 2026-09-09

All notable changes to ZEO Creator are documented here.

## Development inception — 2026-09-07

- Add versioned provider-neutral email campaigns, linear sequences, messages, reviews,
  audience snapshots, exact delivery packages, effect intents and aggregate assessments.
- Register seven input-only email capabilities alongside all existing v1 capabilities.
- Preserve newsletter schemas and add an explicit common-message specialization path.
- Ship three-publication offline conformance, schemas, digest vectors and documentation
  in the wheel. Live Zeocore email interoperability remains pending its public contract.
- Clarify that Runtime/Newsroom acquire and persist observations before Creator invocation.
- No dependency upgrade, PyPI publication or live provider execution.

## 0.2.0.dev0 — 2026-09-05

- Harden evidence lineage, delivery attestations, canonical digests, timestamps,
  performance semantics, and distribution packaging for product-readiness.
- Replace producer-specific public contracts with `ContentBrief`, extensible
  content kinds, artifact bundles, declarative attestations, and opaque extensions.
- Generalize portfolio planning to explicit windows and caller-supplied quantities.
- Ship versioned JSON Schemas in the wheel with list, inspect, and export commands.
- Replace branded factory fixtures with neutral two-publication examples.
- Rename `DailyPerformanceAssessment` to cadence-neutral `PerformanceAssessment`.
- Replace shared publication payloads with destination-specific distribution
  variants that bind channel, selected artifacts, content, accessibility text,
  optional extensions, and schedules.
- Add RFC 8785 schema digests and an explicit package/capability/schema
  compatibility policy to the bundled contract catalog.
- Add the continuous editorial kernel: source observations, signals, immutable
  story revisions, frozen dossiers, agendas, publication slots, and editions.
- Add provider-neutral commentary, newsletter, journalism, human-review, and
  correction contracts with deterministic reference strategies.
- Expand the registry to twenty independently composable capabilities without
  adding workflow persistence, scheduling, credentials, or publishing authority.
