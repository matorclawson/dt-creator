# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Add `zeo-creator check-length-budgets` (output schema `zeocreator.length-budgets/v1`; input `length-budgets/1`), the generic word-budget check as a command, so an agent or a newsroom seat can check a draft without importing Python. JSON on stdout, the error schema for malformed input, exit 0 within budget, 20 when a budget is broken, 2 for invalid input. It is listed in `help --json`; it is not a capability, so `capabilities`, the registry and the provider inventory are unchanged. `lint-thread` now shares the same input reader; its output is unchanged.
- Add `zeo_creator.services.length_budgets.check_length_budgets`, a generic deterministic word-budget check: the caller supplies every budget, it names each breach and never trims. Add `zeo_creator.reference.newsletter_rubric`, an **illustrative** newsletter rubric (`example.newsletter`: five generic scored criteria, an 80 of 100 bar, no criterion under 60%) with example budgets for `intro`, `item` and `outro` sections. It is caller-owned data, not a capability or scorer, and not the production policy: the consuming newsroom owns its production criteria, weights, threshold and budgets. No model is called and no registry or manifest changes.
- Correct stale documentation after the 0.6.1 release: the CHANGELOG and release notes now date 0.6.1 as published and the release notes install 0.6.1 (was 0.6.0, never published); the release-readiness gate wording gives the real test counts (566 source pytest tests, 55 Node tests, 34 installed-wheel conformance tests); ADR 0003 no longer says "both" for three pin moves, no longer shows a 2026-10-13 update date, and says Creator 0.6.0 was never published.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-10-27
- Set up Node 24 in the publish workflow's verify job (`actions/setup-node` v7.1.0, pinned by commit) because `make verify` asserts Node 24 and the runner image ships Node 22. The `v0.6.0` publish run stopped at that step and nothing reached PyPI; the version moves to 0.6.1, which is the first published release of the 0.6 content. The `v0.6.0` tag is left as it is. The verify-and-build steps move into a shared composite action (`.github/actions/verify-build`) that the publish workflow and a new `Release path` pull-request workflow both call, so the release path runs, without any upload, on every pull request that touches it.

- The PR smoke job no longer persists the checkout token in the workspace (`persist-credentials: false` on `actions/checkout` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; Council P3 on the smoke cut).
- Add offline CANDIDATE-only publication-core archive/index verification, isolated consumer and refusal tests; package/runtime/declaration identities stay unchanged and declaration type soundness remains unqualified.
- Move the exact Zeocore pin to `zeocore[runtime-host]==0.28.0` (approved by the Architect, ans_4b0508f0991cd9c5). The doctor check id is `zeocore_0_28_0`. The pin, lock, guards and mirrors are the only change.
- Add the generic review rubric: the `ReviewRubric` and `RubricScorecard` contracts and the pure, fail-closed capability `creator.evaluate_rubric@1.0.0` (the 30th capability; the runtime-provider inventory changes). Creator ships the shape and the engine only: no rubric instance, scorer, lexicon, persona or profile.
- Point repository, documentation, badge and package-metadata links at `ducktyper-ai/dt-creator` and `ducktyper-ai.github.io/dt-creator` after the repository moved to the `ducktyper-ai` organization and was renamed in place (same repository id). The PyPI name `zeocreator`, the `zeo_creator` import, the `zeo-creator` CLI and every schema id are unchanged. The PyPI trusted publisher must be bound to the new repository name before a release; the old Pages address stops resolving.

Same content as 0.6.0 plus the publish-workflow Node 24 setup above; 0.6.0 was tagged but never published. 0.6.1 reached PyPI on 2026-10-27 from the `v0.6.1` tag.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-13 (tagged, never published)

- Add the `thread-authoring` skill (`skills/thread-authoring/SKILL.md`) with `zeo-creator lint-thread` and `zeo_creator.thread_lint`, a deterministic structural linter for a numbered post thread (`thread-draft/1`): 280-character limit counted as NFC code points with URLs as 23, numbering, source outside the posts, link dependence, a repeating last post, and caller-supplied forbidden phrases. It reports what needs a reviewer under `needs_review`. Output schema `zeocreator.thread-lint/v1`; exits 0 clean, 20 findings, 2 invalid. It refuses control, default-ignorable, unassigned and ambiguous-space characters and a post hidden inside another, and rejects duplicate JSON keys. Not a registered capability; the runtime-provider inventory is unchanged.
- Import the five-commit publication-core history without squash, then separately neutralize the private zero-dependency ESM package at `packages/publication-core/`. Its Node 24 contract/export and failure-path tests run in `make verify`; actual Python wheel and sdist checks refuse inclusion of `packages/`. No Python contract/version, provider, npm dependency, release or consumer adoption changes.
- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md`, a contributors charter written for agents first (how to propose, what is welcome, owner-only areas, how to build and submit, response times), linked from `AGENTS.md`.
- Point repository, documentation, badge and package-metadata links at `zeroemployeeorg/zeocreator` and `zeroemployeeorg.github.io/zeocreator` after the repository move; the old GitHub Pages address no longer resolves. Version tags and commit pins are unchanged.
- State the required PyPI trusted publisher and that its current configuration is unverified since the move.
- **CLI output follows Zeocore's `cli_protocol` 1.** Every command except `runtime-provider` prints exactly one JSON line on stdout, the result, which carries `ok`. Lists are wrapped: `capabilities` answers `{"ok": true, "capabilities": [...]}` (or `"tools"` with `--projection openai`), `contracts list` answers `"contracts"`, `contract-schema` answers `"json_schema"`, and `--version` answers `{"ok": true, "zeocreator": ..., "cli_protocol": "1"}`. Every result also names its schema id. The tables are gone; `--json` is still accepted and changes nothing. A usage error prints its usage on stderr and an `invalid_request` result on stdout; running with no command is a usage error.
- **Exit codes follow `cli_protocol` 1** (catch-up: merged in #20 without an entry): a failed `doctor` check exits 20, not 1; 1 is an internal error, with `{"ok": false, "outcome": "internal"}` and no detail; 2 is invalid input.
- `runtime-provider` keeps its canonical bytes, without `ok`, until Runtime confirms a reader for the JSON-lines form; then it changes in one release.
- Add `make install VERSION=X.Y.Z`, which installs a published release as a tool and runs `doctor` (catch-up: merged in #20 without an entry).
- Publishing runs in the GitHub environments `pypi` and `testpypi`, so an upload waits for approval once the environment requires a reviewer.
- Drop the direct `rich` dependency, which the CLI no longer uses; Typer still installs it.
- **Agentic experience (standard v1):** `zeo-creator help --json` is a machine catalogue of every command, option, exit code and output schema id. Every result carries `"schema": "zeocreator.<thing>/v1"`. `contract-schema` now answers the schema under `json_schema` (unreleased rename; `schema` is the id). Shell-completion options are gone.
- `make verify` can write its builds outside the checkout: `DIST_DIR` and `SITE_DIR` (defaults `dist` and `site`) set where `uv build` and `mkdocs` write, and the distribution checks read `ZEOCREATOR_DIST_DIR`.
- **Next steps (standard v1, rules 6 and 7):** `doctor` lists each failing check with the command that fixes it, under `next`. An invalid request carries a fixed `reason` and a `next` command, never the input. The unknown-contract `message` (unreleased) becomes `reason`.
- Email links refuse a backslash, which browsers read as a path separator but URL parsers don't, so a link can't show one host and open another. This applies to `EmailLink` and the body renderer alike.
- Add `zeo_creator.rendering.render_email_body`, a pure renderer from structured blocks to an accessible, escaped HTML fragment for a template slot, with its plain-text twin and digests that match `EmailDeliveryMaterial`.
- **Require `zeocore[runtime-host]==0.28.0`** (was 0.11.0; qualified at 0.15.0 and 0.18.0, then moved to 0.28.0 because the consuming newsroom's draft path needs it; the runtime-host-v1 protocol files are byte-identical at 0.15.0, 0.18.0 and 0.28.0). Zeocore 0.15.0 made every runtime-host name Creator uses public. `doctor` reports the check as `zeocore_0_28_0`.
- **Fix:** the reference story-revision strategy chains same-topic signals in one batch into successive revisions (1, 2, ...) with `previous_revision_ref` set, instead of several unrelated revision 1s of one story. Reference artifacts and contract digests are unchanged.
- **Fix:** `extract_editorial_signals`, `update_story_revisions` and `build_story_dossier` refuse an injected strategy's output that cites a signal, source, revision, story or lineage reference that is not an input of the same call.
- Add the shared JCS test vectors v1 and wire rule 7 (a digest covers the fully materialized contract), and ADR 0003 on bounded Zeocore compatibility.
